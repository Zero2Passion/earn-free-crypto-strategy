This is a rundown of how I earned cryptocurrencies with next to no upfront capital and very little time investment (excluding initial setup that is).

## Step 1: Setup Mail Account

You're going to want to setup an independent mail account. You're going to be signing up to multiple services, and as such will be receiving quite a lot of mails in the form of news, marketing, etc. You don't want to be spamming your current mailbox with all this stuff. It's way better to have everything go up to a dedicated account.

Also, you're going to be signing up to social media accounts, etc., and won't want to use your current social handles to get free crypto. Having a dedicated email for this is going to pay off in the long run.

I recommend just going to [Gmail](https://gmail.com) and registering a new mail account - e.g. mycryptoaccount@gmail.com
